## Joint Longitudinal–Survival Modeling  
**Likelihood Derivation and Simulation-Based Evaluation**

This paper develops and evaluates a shared-parameter joint model linking a longitudinal internal covariate process to a time-to-event outcome through shared random effects.

### Overview
The work derives the full joint likelihood for a linear mixed-effects longitudinal model coupled with a transformation survival model, encompassing proportional hazards, proportional odds, and Box–Cox families as special cases. Estimation is performed via maximum likelihood using an EM algorithm that integrates over subject-specific random effects.

### Methods
- Linear mixed-effects model for the longitudinal process  
- Transformation survival model with nonparametric baseline hazard  
- Shared random-effects structure inducing dependence between processes  
- Full joint-likelihood estimation via EM  
- Monte Carlo simulation study comparing:
  - joint-likelihood estimator  
  - conventional two-stage (plug-in) estimator  

### Key Findings
Simulation results show that the joint-likelihood estimator provides stable, near-unbiased recovery of the longitudinal–survival association across varying levels of measurement error, censoring, and association strength. In contrast, the two-stage estimator exhibits systematic bias and sensitivity to measurement error and model misspecification.

### Purpose
This project demonstrates principled likelihood construction, careful treatment of internal time-dependent covariates, and simulation-based evaluation of estimator behavior in complex longitudinal–survival settings.
