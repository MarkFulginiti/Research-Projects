## Research Projects

This repository contains self-contained research projects focused on causal inference, statistical modeling, and simulation-based evaluation of estimator behavior. Each project lives in its own folder with a dedicated paper and README.

These were developed as coursework projects in the Johns Hopkins University Applied and Computational Mathematics program and are intended to demonstrate research-level modeling, simulation design, and methodological reasoning.

### Projects
- Joint Longitudinal–Survival Modeling
Likelihood derivation and simulation-based evaluation of shared-parameter joint models linking longitudinal processes to time-to-event outcomes. Emphasis on principled likelihood construction, internal time-dependent covariates, and comparison of joint-likelihood and two-stage estimators.

- Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design
Simulation-based examination of fuzzy regression discontinuity estimators, with emphasis on weak compliance, finite-sample instability, and robust inference. The project highlights near-zero denominator behavior, variance inflation under weak identification, and best-practice inference using bias-corrected methods.
